# Other-Projects
This is a description of some projects in which I have participated but whose repositories are currently private. 

However, I wanted to add that I have also participated in other projects, but the related repositories are private and belong to other colleagues, so it is not possible for me to make them public. 

The following is a short list of the main private projects that I was part of which are not listed in my git:
- Development of a video game in Unity - Bloodlines 
(https://claudiosavelli.itch.io/bloodlines)
- Development of Amazon Go style smart shop application (slides with a 
detailed description of the project attached in the following repo)
